# Final Project - Computer Engineering Lab
This project is meant to simulate an online store, complete with simulated purchases and updates to existing catalogue. A user can add items to a cart and then the system will calculate the bill, including any additional service charges or discounts.

The users of the application will be able to
- add customer information, including name, address, and contact details
- edit and modify customer information, including what mentioned above
- delete customer information
- add products or services information, including name, price, and eventual 
  discounts related to number of bought items
- edit and modify products or services information, including what 
  mentioned above
- delete products or services information
- assign products or services to customers (simulating a purchase).

The system will allow users to calculate bills for products or services customers purchase. 

The system will be able to calculate the total amount payable--including taxes and discounts--based on the items listed in the bill.
